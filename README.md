# EV Sales Share Forecast (2030)

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for Janise and Akshit's Stat 157 (Forecasting Class) final project.
We created a forecast for the **EV sales share of all cars sold in the United States in the year 2030**.

Our predictions using IEA data (exponential/quadratic and S-curve fitting) for Trend Extrapolation can be found in the `iea.ipynb` file.
The data used for these predictions are included in the repository.
The most recent version can be downloaded from the [IEA website](https://api.iea.org/evs/?parameter=EV%20sales%20share&mode=Cars&category=Historical&csv=true).

The `Simulation.ipynb` file contains our simulation for the Computer Simulation section.

Install dependencies required to run the notebooks:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
